## 💡 Exam Strategy

### Question Paper Analysis

**Typical Structure:**

- Section A: Short questions (5 × 2 = 10 marks)
- Section B: Long questions (Choose 7 from 10, each 10 marks)
- Total: 80 marks

### Question Selection Strategy

#### Step 1: Scan the Paper (5 minutes)

- Read all questions quickly
- Identify your prepared questions
- Mark easy/medium/hard

#### Step 2: Prioritize (Mental)

- **Category A:** Questions you can answer perfectly (aim for 5-6)
- **Category B:** Questions you can attempt decently (pick 1-2)
- **Category C:** Skip

#### Step 3: Attempt Order

1. **First:** All Category A questions (60-70 marks)
2. **Then:** Best Category B questions (if time)
3. **Skip:** Category C entirely

### Time Management

| Task              | Time        | Tips                             |
| ----------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| Reading paper     | 5 min       | Mark questions while reading     |
| Section A (Short) | 25-30 min   | 5 min per question max           |
| Section B (Long)  | 140-150 min | 20-25 min per question           |
| Review            | 10-15 min   | Check if all questions attempted |

**Golden Rule:** Don't spend more than 25 minutes on any question

### Answer Writing Strategy

#### For Long Questions (10 marks)

**Structure:**

1. **Introduction** (1-2 lines) - Define or introduce topic
2. **Main Content** (70% of answer)
   - Use points/subheadings
   - Include diagrams where applicable
   - Give examples if asked
3. **Conclusion** (1-2 lines) - Summarize or conclude
4. **Diagram/Example** (if applicable) - 2-3 marks here

**Length:** 1.5 to 2 pages

#### For Short Questions (2 marks)

**Structure:**

- 1-2 sentences OR
- 3-4 bullet points OR
- 1 diagram with label

**Length:** 4-5 lines max

### Maximizing Marks

**Do's:**

- ✅ Use headings and subheadings
- ✅ Underline key terms
- ✅ Draw diagrams clearly with labels
- ✅ Number your points
- ✅ Write neatly (examiner's mood matters!)
- ✅ Attempt all required questions
- ✅ Use technical terminology correctly

**Don'ts:**

- ❌ Don't leave questions blank
- ❌ Don't write in paragraphs only (use points)
