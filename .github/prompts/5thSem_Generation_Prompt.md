## 📊 Analysis Methodology

### Data Sources Required:

1. ✅ **Question Sets (7 total)**

   - 2076 Questions
   - 2077 Questions
   - 2078 Questions
   - 2079 Questions
   - 2080 Questions

### Analysis Process:

#### Step 1: Question Extraction

- Extract all questions from 7 sets
- Categorize by chapter
- Tag with marks, year, type

#### Step 2: Frequency Analysis

- Count question repetitions
- Identify pattern variations
- Calculate topic weightage

#### Step 3: Importance Calculation

```
Importance Score = (Frequency × 0.4) + (Marks × 0.3) + (Recency × 0.3)

Where:
- Frequency = How many times asked (0-7)
- Marks = Average marks allocated (normalized 0-1)
- Recency = Weighted by year (2081=1.0, 2076=0.5)
```

#### Step 4: Strategic Planning

- Create study schedules based on importance scores
- Optimize for maximum marks with minimum time
- Develop question selection strategies
