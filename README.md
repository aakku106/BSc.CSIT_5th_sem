## 📚 Methodology

### Analysis Process

1. **Data Collection**

   - 7 years of question papers (2076-2081)
   - Model question sets
   - Official syllabus documents

2. **Pattern Recognition** (Claude Sonnet 4.5)

   - Question frequency analysis
   - Topic importance calculation
   - Strategic planning

3. **Content Creation** (GPT-5)

   - Detailed answer generation
   - Concept explanations
   - Practice problems

4. **Visual Design** (Gemini 2.5 Pro)

   - Diagrams and flowcharts
   - Quick reference materials

### Importance Calculation Formula

```
Importance Score = (Frequency × 0.4) + (Marks × 0.3) + (Recency × 0.3)

Where:
- Frequency = How many times asked (0-7)
- Marks = Average marks allocated (normalized)
- Recency = Weighted by year (2081=1.0, 2076=0.5)
```
