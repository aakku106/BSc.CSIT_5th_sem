Section A

Attempt any two questions.

1
Why model of a system is built? What is static model? Differentiate between static and dynamic mathematical models in simulation.

2
What is storage in GPSS? Describe the blocks associated to storage in GPSS. A machine tool in a manufacturing shop is turning out parts at the rate off one every 5 minutes. As they are finished the parts go on an inspector who takes 10 ± 3 minutes to examine each one and rejects 10% of the parts. Represent the system in GPSS using the concept of facility and run the simulation for 500 parts.

3
What are the two main properties of random numbers? Test whether the 3rd, 7th, 11th, and so on numbers in the sequence in the following random number sample are auto-correlated. (Zα=0.05 and Z0.025=1.96)

0.12 0.01 0.23 0.28 0.89 0.31 0.64 0.28 0.83 0.93 0.99 0.15 0.33 0.35 0.91 0.41 0.60 0.27 0.75 0.88 0.68 0.49 0.05 0.43 0.95 0.58 0.19 0.36 0.69 0.87

Section B

4
Explain Markov chain with suitable example.

5
What are steps involved in simulation study? Explain.

6
Generate 10 random integers using Linear congruential method where m=1000, a =19, c=6 and X0=13

7
Explain different estimation methods which are used in simulation output analysis.

8

9

10
What is calling population? Explain arrival and service process in a queue.

11
Explain Monte Carlo simulation method with example.

12
