SECTION A

Attempt any TWO question.

1
What is queuing system ? Explain the elements of queuing system with example.

2
What are the properties of random number ? The sequence of numbers 0.54, 0.73, 0.98, 0.11 and 0.68 has been generated. Use the Kolmogorov Smirnove test with level of significance (α) 0.05 to determine if the hypothesis that the numbers are uniformly distributed on the interval 0 to 1 can be rejected. (Note that the value of D for α = 0.05 ans N = 5 is 0.565).

3
What is a system modeling? What are the steps involved in system modeling.

SECTION B
