3 step validation for simulation
what do you mean y calibration and validation of model

---

**3-Step Validation Process**:

1. **Face Validity**: Do experts think it looks reasonable?
2. **Validation of Model Assumptions**: Are assumptions realistic?
3. **Input-Output Validation**: Does output match real system data?

**Calibration**:
Tuning model parameters to match real data (adjusting to fit reality)

- Example: Adjusting arrival rate from 10/hr to 12/hr to match actual data

**Validation**:
Checking if calibrated model accurately represents reality (testing if it fits)

- Example: Running model with 12/hr and comparing results to real observations

**Key Difference**:

- Calibration = ADJUSTING parameters
- Validation = TESTING accuracy
