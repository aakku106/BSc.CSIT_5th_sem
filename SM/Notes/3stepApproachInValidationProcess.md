# Three Step Validation Process

- Build the model having high face validity
- VAlidaet model assumptions
- compare the model input output tranformations to crossponding i/o tranformations to real system
This outlines in 1 scentense as build the wirht model -> build the model right -> check result reality

1. Face validity
- Build a resonable model on its face to model users who are knowlagable aboout the real system being simulated
