# Intern-Level Reality Checks

## How do you debug when something doesn't work?

When something does not work, I start by reproducing the issue consistently to understand exactly what is failing and under what conditions.

I read error messages carefully, as they often point directly to the problem. I search for the specific error message or symptoms to see if others have encountered similar issues.

I use console.log statements or debugging tools to inspect variable values, execution flow, and state at different points to identify where behavior diverges from expectations.

I isolate the problem by simplifying—commenting out code, creating minimal reproductions, or testing individual components separately to narrow down the source of the issue.

If I remain stuck after systematic investigation, I document what I have tried and what I have learned about the problem, then seek help by clearly explaining the issue and my debugging attempts.

## What do you do when you're stuck?

When I am stuck, I first take a step back and re-read the problem or error message to ensure I understand what I am actually trying to solve. Sometimes initial assumptions are incorrect.

I search for the specific error or concept in documentation, Stack Overflow, or GitHub issues. I look for official documentation first to understand the intended behavior.

I break the problem into smaller parts and test each piece independently. Often the issue is not where I initially thought, and systematic testing reveals the actual source.

If I am still stuck after reasonable effort, I ask for help. I prepare a clear explanation of the problem, what I have tried, what I expected versus what actually happened, and any relevant code or error messages.

Taking breaks also helps. Stepping away and returning with fresh perspective often reveals solutions I overlooked when focused too narrowly on the problem.

## How do you read documentation?

I start with overview sections or getting started guides to understand what the tool or library does and its core concepts before diving into specific APIs.

I focus on examples and code samples, as they often demonstrate patterns and usage more clearly than descriptions alone. I try running examples myself to see how they work.

When looking for specific functionality, I use search or scan the table of contents rather than reading sequentially. I look for the specific method, component, or concept I need.

I pay attention to notes about version compatibility, deprecation warnings, and common pitfalls, as these often explain confusing behavior or prevent mistakes.

I keep documentation open while working and refer back frequently rather than trying to memorize everything. Understanding where to find information is more important than remembering every detail.

## How do you handle feedback?

I listen carefully to feedback without becoming defensive, focusing on understanding the concern rather than immediately justifying my approach.

I ask clarifying questions if I do not understand the feedback or need more context about why a particular change is suggested. Understanding the reasoning helps me learn and improve.

I separate feedback about my work from feedback about my personal worth. Code can always be improved, and feedback is an opportunity to learn better practices and see different perspectives.

I implement feedback thoughtfully, ensuring I understand why the change improves the code rather than blindly following suggestions. This helps me learn principles I can apply to future work.

I express appreciation for feedback, even when it is critical, because it represents time someone invested in helping me improve.

## How do you handle code reviews?

I approach code reviews as a learning opportunity and a collaborative process to improve code quality, not as a judgment of my abilities.

When receiving review comments, I read them carefully, implement suggested changes, and ask questions when I do not understand the reasoning behind a suggestion.

I respond to each comment, either confirming I made the change, explaining my approach if I chose a different solution, or asking for clarification if needed.

When I cannot implement a suggestion immediately, I communicate this clearly and propose alternatives or next steps rather than leaving comments unaddressed.

I learn from patterns in feedback. If multiple people comment on similar issues, I focus on improving in those areas to avoid repeating mistakes.

## How do you estimate how long a task will take?

I break the task into smaller, concrete steps and estimate each step individually. This provides more accurate estimates than trying to estimate the entire task at once.

I account for unknowns by adding buffer time for unexpected issues, learning new concepts, or dealing with dependencies. Early in my career, I recognize my estimates may be less accurate.

I consider similar tasks I have done before and how long they took, adjusting for differences in complexity or familiarity.

I am honest when I am uncertain about an estimate, explaining what factors make it difficult to predict rather than providing a number I am not confident in.

As I work, if I realize a task will take longer than estimated, I communicate this early rather than waiting until the deadline approaches.

## Have you worked with deadlines?

I have worked with deadlines in robotics competitions, where specific dates were fixed and missing them meant not being able to compete. This taught me to prioritize ruthlessly and make tradeoffs.

In academic projects, I have managed multiple assignments with overlapping deadlines, requiring planning and time management to complete everything on schedule.

These experiences taught me to start early, break work into incremental milestones, and identify critical path items that must be completed before other work can proceed.

I learned that communicating early about potential delays is better than hoping to catch up. If deadlines are at risk, explaining the situation and proposing solutions maintains trust.

I understand that professional deadlines involve coordinating with others whose work depends on mine, making reliability and communication even more critical than in academic settings.

## How do you balance college and work?

I manage college and work by creating clear schedules that allocate specific time blocks for each responsibility, treating both as serious commitments.

I prioritize based on urgency and importance, understanding that both college coursework and internship responsibilities require dedication and cannot be treated as optional.

I communicate with both professors and supervisors about my schedule and commitments, ensuring expectations are clear and that I can meet obligations to both.

I use time management techniques like breaking work into focused sessions, minimizing distractions during work time, and being realistic about how much I can accomplish in a given period.

I am willing to adjust my schedule and make sacrifices in other areas to ensure I meet both academic and professional commitments. I understand that balancing both requires discipline and organization.
