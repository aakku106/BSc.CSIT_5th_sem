# Legacy Technologies Assessment

## You listed C++ / C# / Python / SQL — how well do you know them?

I am being honest about my current proficiency with these technologies. While I have exposure to them through coursework or brief exploration, they are not my primary focus or areas of strength.

C++ I learned in academic contexts for data structures and algorithms courses. I understand object-oriented programming concepts and basic syntax, but I would not consider myself proficient for production C++ development.

C# I have minimal experience with, primarily from exploring game development with Unity. My knowledge is limited to basic syntax and Unity-specific patterns, not general C# application development.

Python I have used for scripting tasks and academic assignments, particularly for quick prototypes or data processing. I am comfortable with basic Python but lack deep experience with frameworks or large Python projects.

SQL I understand conceptually for database queries and have written basic SELECT, JOIN, INSERT, and UPDATE statements in academic projects, but I lack experience with database design, optimization, or working with production databases.

## When was the last time you used C#?

I used C# approximately six to twelve months ago when experimenting with Unity for game development. This was exploratory work to understand game development concepts rather than building complete projects.

The experience involved writing scripts for game objects, understanding Unity's component system, and implementing basic game mechanics. It was limited to Unity's specific C# usage patterns.

Since then, I have focused on web development technologies like JavaScript, React, and Next.js, which are more aligned with my current career direction toward frontend development.

## Why include them if you don't use them?

I included these technologies to provide a complete picture of my technical background, including academic coursework and exploratory learning, even though they are not my current focus.

I want to be transparent about what I have been exposed to versus what I actively use. Listing them acknowledges that I have foundational knowledge that could be built upon if needed, while being clear about my current proficiency level.

However, I understand this can be misleading, and I am prepared to honestly discuss my actual comfort level with each technology rather than overstating my abilities.

In future resume iterations, I would consider separating technologies I actively use from those I have only academic or introductory experience with, to set clearer expectations.

## If we ask you something in Python, how comfortable are you?

For basic Python tasks like writing scripts, processing data, or implementing algorithms, I am reasonably comfortable. I understand the syntax, common data structures, and standard library basics.

For questions about Python-specific frameworks like Django or Flask, data science libraries like pandas or NumPy, or advanced Python features like decorators or metaclasses, my knowledge is limited.

I can write functioning Python code for straightforward tasks and can read and understand Python code reasonably well. With documentation, I could work through most problems, but it would take me longer than in JavaScript or C.

I would need time to learn framework-specific patterns, best practices, and idioms if the role required production Python development. I am capable of learning but would not claim current proficiency.

## Are you willing to relearn them if needed?

Absolutely. I am willing to learn or relearn any technology that is relevant to the role and valuable for the team.

I have demonstrated ability to learn new technologies independently, as shown by my self-directed learning of Go, Next.js, and deployment infrastructure. I approach new technologies systematically through documentation, building projects, and iterating based on feedback.

If the role required Python, SQL, or other technologies I currently have limited experience with, I would invest the necessary time to reach proficiency. I understand that technology is a tool, and the ability to learn is more valuable than knowing every specific technology.

I would prefer to work primarily with technologies I am currently strong in, like JavaScript and React, but I am not limiting myself to only those technologies. I am open to working with whatever stack best serves the project and team.

My comfort with learning is supported by my academic background in computer science fundamentals, which provides a foundation for understanding new languages and frameworks relatively quickly.
