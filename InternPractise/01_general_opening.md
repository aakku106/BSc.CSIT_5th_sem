# General and Opening Questions

## Walk me through your resume

I am currently a fifth-semester Computer Engineering student at Pulchowk Campus, where I am building a strong foundation in both theoretical computer science and practical software development. My academic journey has been complemented by hands-on experience with modern web technologies.

In terms of technical projects, I have worked with Next.js to build MedFree, a healthcare platform designed to help users find free medical services. This project allowed me to understand server-side rendering, routing, and how to structure a production-ready web application. I also maintain a personal website hosted on Cloudflare, which gave me practical exposure to DNS configuration, deployment workflows, and domain management.

Beyond web development, I am actively learning Go to understand systems programming and backend architecture. I have a solid foundation in C from my coursework, which has helped me grasp memory management, pointers, and how software interacts with hardware at a lower level.

On the leadership side, I served as Team Lead for my college robotics team, where we competed in national and international competitions. This role taught me project coordination, technical decision-making under pressure, and effective team communication.

My current focus is on frontend development with Next.js and React, while continuing to strengthen my understanding of computer science fundamentals through Go and low-level programming.

## What are you currently focusing on technically?

I am currently focusing on frontend development, specifically deepening my understanding of Next.js and React. I am working to understand how these frameworks handle rendering, state management, and performance optimization in real-world applications.

At the same time, I am learning Go to build a stronger understanding of backend systems, concurrency, and memory management. This helps me think about how frontend applications interact with servers and APIs, and how data flows through a full application.

I am also investing time in understanding deployment and infrastructure basics through hands-on work with Cloudflare, DNS, and hosting configurations. My goal is to not only write code but also understand how it gets delivered to users efficiently.

## Why frontend, not backend or full-stack?

I am drawn to frontend development because it sits at the intersection of logic and user experience. I find it satisfying to build interfaces that people directly interact with and to solve problems related to performance, accessibility, and responsiveness.

Frontend work requires understanding both the technical side—how JavaScript executes, how React manages state, how browsers render content—and the practical side of making applications usable and fast. I appreciate this balance.

That said, I am not avoiding backend work. Learning Go and understanding how servers, databases, and APIs function is part of my learning path. I want to be strong in frontend development while having enough backend knowledge to collaborate effectively and understand the full context of the applications I build.

## What kind of internship are you actually looking for?

I am looking for an internship where I can work on real projects that impact users, ideally in a frontend or full-stack role using technologies like React, Next.js, or similar modern frameworks.

I want to work in an environment where I can learn from experienced developers through code reviews, pair programming, and structured feedback. I am specifically interested in understanding how production applications are built, tested, deployed, and maintained at scale.

I am also looking for opportunities to contribute meaningfully, even if that starts with smaller tasks. I want to work somewhere that values learning and allows me to gradually take on more responsibility as I grow.

## What do you expect to learn from this internship?

I expect to learn how professional software development differs from academic projects. This includes understanding code quality standards, testing practices, version control workflows in team settings, and how to write maintainable code that others can work with.

I want to improve my debugging skills and learn how to troubleshoot issues methodically in larger codebases. I also want to understand how teams make architectural decisions, prioritize features, and balance technical debt with shipping products.

On the technical side, I hope to deepen my knowledge of React and Next.js by seeing how they are used in production environments, and to learn about performance optimization, security considerations, and deployment strategies.

Most importantly, I want to learn how to work effectively in a team, how to communicate technical concepts clearly, and how to accept and incorporate feedback to improve my work.

## How do you usually learn a new technology?

When learning a new technology, I start with official documentation to understand the core concepts and design philosophy. I find that understanding why a technology exists and what problems it solves helps me learn it more effectively.

I then build small projects to practice the concepts hands-on. For example, when learning Next.js, I built MedFree to understand routing, server-side rendering, and data fetching. When learning Go, I implemented basic algorithms and command-line tools to get comfortable with the syntax and memory model.

If I get stuck, I search for specific error messages or concepts, read relevant documentation sections carefully, and try to understand the underlying mechanism rather than just copying solutions. I also review code examples from open-source projects to see how experienced developers structure their solutions.

I learn iteratively—starting with basics, building something functional, then revisiting to understand more advanced patterns and optimizations. I also make notes about concepts I find confusing so I can revisit them as my understanding deepens.
