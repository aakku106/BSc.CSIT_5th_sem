# Behavioral and Personality

## What kind of teammate are you?

I am a collaborative teammate who values clear communication and shared understanding of goals. I believe good teamwork comes from everyone understanding not just their own tasks but how they fit into the larger project.

I am reliable and take ownership of my responsibilities. When I commit to a task, I follow through and communicate proactively if I encounter obstacles or need help.

I ask questions when I do not understand something rather than making assumptions, which helps prevent wasted effort and ensures I am working toward the right goals.

I am willing to help teammates when they are stuck, sharing knowledge and collaborating on problems. I also recognize when others have expertise I lack and actively seek their input.

I value feedback and constructive disagreement because they lead to better solutions. I focus on finding the best approach rather than defending my initial ideas.

## Do you prefer working alone or in a team?

I appreciate both individual work and team collaboration, as they serve different purposes. I enjoy the focused thinking that comes from working alone on well-defined problems.

However, I recognize that complex projects benefit from diverse perspectives and collaboration. Working in a team provides opportunities to learn from others, validate ideas, and produce better results than any individual could alone.

My preference depends on the task. For deep implementation work or learning new concepts, I work well independently. For design decisions, problem-solving, and code review, collaboration improves outcomes.

What matters most is clear communication about expectations and responsibilities, whether working alone or in a team. Knowing what I am responsible for and how my work connects to others enables me to contribute effectively.

## How do you react when someone says your code is bad?

I try to understand specifically what makes the code problematic rather than taking the comment personally. Code quality is something I can improve, and criticism is an opportunity to learn.

I ask for specific examples and explanations of what could be better. Understanding why something is considered bad code helps me learn principles I can apply elsewhere.

I recognize that as someone early in my career, my code will have issues that more experienced developers will catch. This is expected and part of the learning process.

I appreciate when people take time to review my code and provide feedback, even when it is critical, because it means they are invested in helping me improve.

After understanding the issues, I work to correct them and internalize the lessons to avoid repeating the same mistakes in future work.

## What frustrates you while coding?

I find it frustrating when I do not understand why something is not working and cannot find clear information or error messages to guide debugging. Vague errors or inconsistent behavior make progress difficult.

Spending significant time on problems caused by undocumented edge cases or confusing API design is frustrating, though I recognize it is part of working with real-world software.

Environment-specific issues that work locally but fail in other environments are particularly challenging because they are difficult to reproduce and debug systematically.

However, I try to manage frustration constructively by taking breaks, approaching problems from different angles, and asking for help when I am stuck rather than persisting unproductively.

I view frustrating problems as learning opportunities that improve my debugging skills and deepen my understanding of how systems work.

## What motivates you to keep learning?

I am motivated by building things that work and solve real problems. Seeing a project come together and function as intended is satisfying and drives me to learn whatever is needed to make that happen.

I find satisfaction in understanding how things work at a deeper level. Learning new concepts that explain previously confusing behavior or connect different pieces of knowledge is intellectually rewarding.

The technology field constantly evolves, and I find that exciting rather than overwhelming. There are always new problems to solve, better tools to learn, and more efficient approaches to discover.

I am also motivated by the desire to contribute effectively to teams and projects. Knowing that my skills enable me to add value and help others achieve their goals provides strong motivation.

Seeing my own progress over time—comparing what I can build now versus months ago—demonstrates that consistent learning produces real results.

## What are you bad at right now?

I am not yet proficient at system design and making architectural decisions for larger applications. I understand component-level code but have limited experience with structuring entire applications for maintainability and scalability.

My testing practices need improvement. While I understand testing concepts, I do not have strong habits around writing tests before or alongside feature implementation.

I am still developing my code review skills. I can review code for obvious errors but lack experience identifying subtle issues related to security, performance, or long-term maintainability.

My communication about technical topics could be more concise and clear. I sometimes provide too much detail or struggle to explain concepts at the right level for the audience.

I also need to improve at estimating task complexity and time requirements, as my limited professional experience makes it difficult to predict how long things will take accurately.

## Where do you think you'll struggle in this internship?

I expect to struggle initially with understanding large, established codebases. Navigating unfamiliar code and understanding architectural patterns used in production applications will take time.

Understanding the business context and priorities behind technical decisions may be challenging at first. In academic projects, requirements are clear, but in real products, there are competing priorities and constraints I have not dealt with.

Working with production-level tooling, testing practices, and deployment processes will be new. I understand the concepts but lack hands-on experience with professional development workflows.

I may need more time than experienced developers for certain tasks as I familiarize myself with the codebase, tools, and practices. I plan to compensate through asking good questions and learning quickly.

Balancing thoroughness with speed will be challenging. In school, I could spend as much time as needed, but professional work requires delivering value within reasonable timeframes.
