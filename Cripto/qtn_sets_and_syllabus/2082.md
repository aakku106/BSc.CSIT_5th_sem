Section A

Attempt any TWO questions.

1
Describe the Fiestel Cipher structure. Given the key {2B, 7E, 15, 16, 28, AE, D2, A6, AB, F7, 97, 66, 01, 02, 03, 04}, compute the first 4 byte of next key after first iteration, using the following S-Box in AES.

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
0 63 7C 77 7B F2 6B 6F C5 30 01 67 2B FE D7 AB 76
