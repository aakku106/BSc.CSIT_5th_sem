SECTION A

Attempt any TWO question.

1
Let us consider the 4 bits key set as {1100, 1010, 0000, 1111, 0101, 1001} and input text as {1011, 1110, 1011, 1000}. Now trace the first full round operation of IDEA algorithm.

2
What is Message Authentication Code? List the operation of computing digest value in different passes of MD4. Describe about Needhom-Schroeder protocol.

3
Why do we need discrete logarithm? Illustrate with an example. Consider a Diffie-Hellman scheme with a common prime p = 13 between user A and user B. Suppose public key of A is 10 and public key of B is 8. Now determine their private keys and shared secret key. Select any valid primitive root of 13.

SECTION B

Totient value of any positive integer.
Properties of hash function.
Virus or Worms.
